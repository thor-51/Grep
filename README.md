Equivalent Grep Command in Python

Grep command is the short form of 'global search for regular expressions'. The Grep command is a filter that is used to search for lines matching a specified pattern and print the matching
lines to a standard output. The Grep command is a command used in Unix/Linux.

Apart from the above, I have added a couple of additional features to enhance the user's experience - 
1) Basic Text Search (Ability to search for a pattern within a single file or multiple files)
2) Regular Expressions (Supports basic regular expressions for more advanced pattern matching)
3) Case Sensitivity (Ability to perform case-sensitive or case-insensitive searches)
4) Output Formatting (Display the matching lines along with the count of such lines)
5) File Inclusion/Exclusion (Ability to exclude files from the search using regular expressions)
6) Recursive Search (Recursive searching through directories)
7) Context Lines (Display a specified number of lines before and after each matching line)
8) Invert Match (Display lines that don't match the pattern)
9) Word Match (Ability to search for whole words)
10) Colorized Output (Display matching text in color for improved visibility)
